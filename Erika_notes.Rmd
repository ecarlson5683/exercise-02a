## Review of how to clone a remote repository

copy the link to the repository from github.com

Open a Terminal window (Tools > Terminal > New Terminal)

Navigate to appropriate directory to save the repository

  `cd ~erc2866/Development/Repos`

  `git clone <repository url>`

```{r}
#simple math
x <- 2
y <- 3
z <- x^y
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
