## Review of how to clone a remote repository

copy the link to the repository from github.com

Open a Terminal window (Tools > Terminal > New Terminal)

Navigate to appropriate directory to save the repository

  `cd ~erc2866/Development/Repos`

  `git clone <repository url>`

```{r}
#simple math
x <- 2
y <- 3
z <- x^y
```

## Questions
To push up changes, I had to create a new Rproject for exercise-02a repository (I had previously been in the Rproject created in Module 6). Is this necessary? How do I get out of the Rproject into general mode?
